In TestNG, the order of execution for various annotations is as follows:

1. `@BeforeSuite`: This annotation is executed before the test suite starts. It is only executed once for the entire suite.

2. `@BeforeTest`: This annotation is executed before each `<test>` tag in the testng.xml file. If there are multiple `<test>` tags, this will be executed before each of them.

3. `@BeforeClass`: This annotation is executed before the first test method in the current class is invoked.

4. `@BeforeMethod`: This annotation is executed before each test method.

5. `@Test`: This annotation represents an individual test method.

6. `@AfterMethod`: This annotation is executed after each test method.

7. `@AfterClass`: This annotation is executed after all the test methods in the current class have been executed.

8. `@AfterTest`: This annotation is executed after all the test methods in each `<test>` tag have been executed.

9. `@AfterSuite`: This annotation is executed after the entire suite has finished executing. It is only executed once for the entire suite.

It's important to note that the execution order of these annotations may vary depending on the test framework and the configuration settings used in TestNG.
