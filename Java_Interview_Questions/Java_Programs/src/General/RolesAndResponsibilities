Few important points to explain current roles and responsibility as a software tester.

As a tester responsible for both functional and test automation, my current roles and responsibilities include the following:

Requirement Analysis: I work closely with business analysts, product managers, and developers to understand the requirements and specifications of the application. This ensures that I have a clear understanding of the expected functionality and can create relevant test cases.

Test Planning: I develop a comprehensive test plan that outlines the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for the testing activities. This plan serves as a guide for the testing process and helps to ensure that all necessary tests are executed.

Test Case Design: I create detailed test cases for both manual and automated testing, ensuring that all relevant scenarios are covered. This includes positive, negative, boundary, and edge cases to validate the application's functionality, performance, and security.

Test Automation: I develop and maintain automated test scripts using tools like Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, and TestNG. This helps to increase test coverage, reduce testing time, and improve the overall efficiency of the testing process.

Test Execution: I execute manual and automated tests to identify defects, inconsistencies, and any deviations from the expected functionality. I also prioritize the test cases based on their importance and risk level.

Defect Reporting and Tracking: When I find defects or issues, I log them in a bug tracking system like JIRA or Bugzilla, providing detailed information about the issue, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs. I also collaborate with the development team to ensure timely resolution of the issues.

Regression Testing: I perform regression testing to verify that any changes or bug fixes have not introduced new defects or affected existing functionality. This is crucial to maintaining the overall quality and stability of the application.

Test Reporting: I generate test reports to provide insights into the testing process, including the number of test cases executed, passed, failed, and the overall test coverage. These reports help stakeholders understand the progress and quality of the application under test.

Continuous Improvement: I actively participate in team meetings, retrospectives, and process improvement initiatives to share my insights and learn from my colleagues, ensuring that our testing practices remain effective and efficient.
