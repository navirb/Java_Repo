The main difference between `String` and `StringBuffer` in Java lies in their mutability and performance characteristics:

1. Mutability: `String` objects are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed once they are created. Any operation that appears to modify a `String` actually creates a new `String` object. In contrast, `StringBuffer` objects are mutable, allowing for modification of the character sequence they hold.

2. Performance: Due to its immutability, `String` is generally more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance when it comes to operations like concatenation, substring, and searching. However, since new `String` objects are created whenever a modification is made, repeated modifications can result in excessive memory usage and performance degradation. `StringBuffer`, on the other hand, provides a mutable buffer that allows for efficient modification of its character sequence, making it more suitable for frequent modifications.

3. Thread Safety: `String` objects are inherently thread-safe because they are immutable, meaning that they can be safely shared between multiple threads without the risk of data corruption. `StringBuffer`, on the other hand, provides synchronized methods, making it thread-safe for concurrent access and modification. This makes `StringBuffer` suitable for scenarios where thread safety is required.

In summary, `String` is suitable for scenarios where immutability and thread safety are desired, and where frequent modifications are not required. `StringBuffer`, with its mutable nature and thread-safe methods, is better suited for scenarios that involve frequent modifications of the character sequence and require thread safety. However, if you are working with Java 5 or later versions, it is recommended to use `StringBuilder` instead of `StringBuffer` in non-thread-safe scenarios, as `StringBuilder` provides similar mutable functionality without the added synchronization overhead of `StringBuffer`.
