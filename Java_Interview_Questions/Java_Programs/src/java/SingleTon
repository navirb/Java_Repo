In Java, a singleton class is a class that allows only one instance of itself to be created and provides a global point of access to that instance. It ensures that only one object of the class is created throughout the application.

Here's an example of implementing a singleton class in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Private static instance variable
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
    private Singleton() {
        // Initialization code
    }

    // Public static method to get the instance of the singleton class
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            // Create a new instance only if it doesn't exist
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Other methods and variables of the singleton class
}
```

In this example, the `Singleton` class has a private static instance variable that holds the single instance of the class. The constructor is private to prevent direct instantiation from other classes. The public static method `getInstance()` is used to provide access to the singleton instance. It checks if the instance is null and creates a new instance if it doesn't exist. Subsequent calls to `getInstance()` will return the existing instance.

By following this approach, you can ensure that only one instance of the `Singleton` class is created, and it can be accessed globally across the application. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a single instance of a class needs to be shared and accessed by multiple components.
