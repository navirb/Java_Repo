APIs use status codes to indicate the outcome of a request. Here are some common HTTP status codes you may encounter when working with APIs:

1. 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data as the response.

2. 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource has been created as a result.

3. 204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return in the response.

4. 400 Bad Request: The request was invalid or malformed, and the server cannot process it.

5. 401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication, and the user is not authenticated or lacks valid credentials.

6. 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but the user does not have sufficient permissions to access the requested resource.

7. 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

8. 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server while processing the request.

9. 502 Bad Gateway: The server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server.

10. 503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to maintenance or being overloaded.

These are just a few examples of the most commonly encountered status codes. There are many more status codes available, each serving a specific purpose and indicating a particular outcome of the request. When working with APIs, it's important to handle different status codes appropriately based on their meaning to ensure robust error handling and response processing.
