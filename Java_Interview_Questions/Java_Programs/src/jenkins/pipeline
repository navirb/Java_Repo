As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or access to specific environments like Jenkins. However, I can provide you with information about configuring pipelines in Jenkins.

Jenkins pipelines are a way to define continuous delivery workflows as code. They allow you to define the steps and actions required to build, test, and deploy your software in a declarative or scripted manner. Here's a general overview of configuring pipelines in Jenkins:

1. Install and Set up Jenkins: Begin by installing Jenkins on your server or machine and setting it up according to your requirements. This typically involves downloading the Jenkins WAR file, running it, and following the setup wizard.

2. Install Pipeline Plugin: Jenkins supports pipelines through the Pipeline plugin. Make sure you have the Pipeline plugin installed in your Jenkins instance. You can install it from the Jenkins plugin manager.

3. Create a Pipeline Job: In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job by selecting "New Item" from the Jenkins dashboard. Choose the "Pipeline" type, provide a name for the job, and click "OK".

4. Define Pipeline Script: In the pipeline configuration, you can define your pipeline script. This script can be written in either Declarative or Scripted syntax. Declarative pipelines use a predefined structure and provide a simplified syntax, while Scripted pipelines allow for more flexibility and customizations using Groovy scripting.

5. Configure Pipeline Options: Configure various options for your pipeline, such as source code management, build triggers, build environments, and post-build actions. This includes specifying the repository URL, branch to build, build triggers (e.g., SCM polling, webhook, or manual), and any additional build steps or actions you need.

6. Save and Run Pipeline: Save the pipeline configuration and trigger a build. Jenkins will execute the pipeline script according to the defined stages and steps. You can monitor the progress and view the build logs in the Jenkins interface.

7. Customize and Extend: You can further customize your pipeline by adding additional stages, steps, or integrations as needed. You can also leverage Jenkins plugins to integrate with various tools and technologies for testing, deployment, and reporting.

It's important to note that configuring pipelines in Jenkins can vary depending on your specific project requirements, tooling, and environment. You may need to refer to the Jenkins documentation and explore additional resources to gain more in-depth knowledge and best practices for configuring pipelines in Jenkins.
