how to run only the failed test cases in cucumber


To run only the failed test cases in Cucumber, you can use the `rerun` plugin provided by Cucumber. This plugin generates a file with the paths of the failed scenarios during the previous test execution. You can then use this file as input to rerun only the failed scenarios. Here's how you can do it:

1. Configure the `rerun` plugin in your Cucumber test runner:
   ```java
   import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
   import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
   import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

   @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
   @CucumberOptions(
       plugin = {"rerun:target/rerun.txt"},
       // other configuration options
   )
   public class RunCucumberTests {
   }
   ```

2. Run your tests for the first time. The `rerun` plugin will generate a `rerun.txt` file in the specified output directory (`target/rerun.txt` in this example).

3. Update your Cucumber test runner to run only the failed scenarios:
   ```java
   import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
   import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
   import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

   @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
   @CucumberOptions(
       features = "@target/rerun.txt",
       // other configuration options
   )
   public class RunFailedScenarios {
   }
   ```

4. Run the `RunFailedScenarios` test runner. It will execute only the failed scenarios listed in the `rerun.txt` file.

By following these steps, you can rerun only the failed scenarios, saving time and effort in retesting the entire test suite.



//how to run the failed test cases in testng

To run only the failed test cases in TestNG, you can utilize the TestNG `rerun-failed` feature. This feature allows you to rerun only the failed tests from a previous test run. Here's how you can do it:

1. Configure the TestNG XML file:
   - Open your TestNG XML configuration file (e.g., `testng.xml`).
   - Add the `rerun-failed` listener to the `<listeners>` section:
     ```xml
     <listeners>
         <listener class-name="org.testng.reporters.RerunListener" />
     </listeners>
     ```
   - Save the changes to the TestNG XML file.

2. Run your tests for the first time. The TestNG `rerun-failed` listener will generate a file named `testng-failed.xml` that contains the failed test cases.

3. Create a new TestNG XML file (e.g., `testng-failed.xml`) specifically for running the failed tests. This file should reference the generated `testng-failed.xml` file from the previous step:
   ```xml
   <!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
   <suite name="Failed Tests Suite">
       <test name="Failed Tests">
           <suite-files>
               <suite-file path="test-output/testng-failed.xml" />
           </suite-files>
       </test>
   </suite>
   ```

4. Run the newly created TestNG XML file (`testng-failed.xml`). It will execute only the failed test cases from the previous test run.

By following these steps, you can rerun only the failed test cases in TestNG, saving time and focusing on fixing the identified issues.
