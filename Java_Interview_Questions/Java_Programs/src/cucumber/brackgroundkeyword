background keyword
In Cucumber, the "Background" keyword is used to define a set of 
common steps that are executed before each scenario in a feature file. 
The Background keyword helps to eliminate duplication of 
steps and makes the feature file more concise and readable.

The Background section typically contains steps that are common 
to all scenarios in a feature file, setting up the initial state or 
context for the scenarios. These steps are executed once before each 
scenario in the feature file, providing a consistent starting point for
the scenarios.

Here's an example of how the Background keyword is used in a feature file:

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart

  Background:
    Given the user is on the shopping website
    And the user has logged in

  Scenario: Add item to the cart
    When the user searches for "iPhone"
    And selects the first search result
    And adds the item to the cart
    Then the item should be added successfully

  Scenario: Remove item from the cart
    When the user goes to the cart page
    And removes the item from the cart
    Then the item should be removed successfully
```

In this example, the Background section 
defines the common steps that are executed 
before each scenario. The steps "Given the user is on the shopping website"
 and "And the user has logged in" are executed 
 before the "Add item to the cart" and "Remove item from the cart" scenarios.
  These steps help set up the initial state for the scenarios and 
  ensure that the user is on the shopping website and logged 
 in before proceeding with the scenario-specific steps.

By using the Background keyword, you can avoid repeating the same 
set of steps in each scenario and make your feature files more 
concise and focused on the specific behavior being tested 
in each scenario.
