what are hooks in cucumber

In Cucumber, hooks are blocks of code that allow you to 
perform certain actions before or after specific events
 during the test execution cycle. Hooks provide a way to 
 set up the test environment, perform setup and teardown activities, 
 and define additional behavior for scenarios and steps. 
 Hooks are written in Java or other supported programming 
 languages and are executed automatically at certain points 
 in the test execution lifecycle.

Here are the different types of hooks available in Cucumber:

1. Before: The Before hook is executed before each scenario. 
It is commonly used to set up the test environment or 
initialize necessary resources before executing the scenario.

2. After: The After hook is executed after each scenario. 
It is used to perform cleanup tasks, tear down resources, 
or capture screenshots or logs after executing the scenario.

3. BeforeStep: The BeforeStep hook is executed before 
each step in the scenario. It is used to perform actions 
before each individual step, such as logging or taking 
specific actions based on the step being executed.

4. AfterStep: The AfterStep hook is executed after each 
step in the scenario. It is used to perform actions after 
each individual step, such as capturing screenshots or logging.

Hooks can be defined at different levels:

- Global Hooks: Global hooks are defined once and apply to 
all scenarios across feature files. They are typically defined 
in a separate class or file.

- Tagged Hooks: Hooks can be tagged with specific tags 
and will only be executed when the corresponding scenarios or 
features are tagged accordingly. This allows for more 
fine-grained control over when hooks are executed.

Hooks are a powerful feature in Cucumber as they enable you 
to perform setup and teardown activities, customize behavior, 
and integrate with external systems or tools. 
They enhance the reusability and maintainability 
of your test code by keeping common actions centralized 
and executed automatically at the appropriate points 
in the test execution cycle.
